# LibraryManagementSystemCSharp
This is basic project for developing a library management system. I am doing this because:-
    1. In order to learn Visual Studio
    2. Be more familiar with git and GitHub
    3. Understanding C# and .NET framework
    4. Going to use for my own small home library (Yes! I am Bookaholic or better BookAcholic!)

Targeted Problem :-
    1. Organization of books
    2. Check status of book (issued, returend, out of order, to be purchased)
    3. Create basic genres

To be used by:-
    1. Schools
    2. Home Library
    3. Local Library
    4. By me for my small home library and people like me who are fond of reading, collecting books
